# Project Description: Pizza Sales Analysis Using SQL and Power BI

# Introduction:
The Pizza Sales Analysis project aims to provide valuable insights and actionable information to a pizza restaurant chain by analyzing their sales data. This project combines the power of SQL for data manipulation and extraction and Power BI for data visualization, allowing the stakeholders to make informed decisions, identify trends, and optimize their business strategies.

# Objective: 
The main objective of this project is to analyze the pizza sales data to gain a comprehensive understanding of the restaurant's performance, identify top-selling products, peak sales periods, customer preferences, and geographic trends. By leveraging SQL and Power BI, the project will create interactive dashboards and reports that facilitate better decision-making and contribute to the restaurant chain's overall growth and success.

# Methodology:
1.    Data Extraction: The first step involves extracting the relevant data from the database using SQL queries. This process will involve joining multiple tables, filtering data, and aggregating information to prepare a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
2.    Data Cleaning: Once the data is extracted, it will be cleaned to handle any missing or inconsistent values. Data normalization and standardization will be performed to ensure accuracy and uniformity in the analysis.
3.    Data Transformation: The cleaned data will undergo transformations to derive essential metrics, such as total sales, average order value, customer demographics, popular pizza toppings, and sales by location and time.
4.    Data Analysis: With the transformed data, various SQL queries will be employed to conduct in-depth analysis, such as identifying top-selling pizza varieties, calculating revenue trends, determining customer retention rates, and finding correlations between sales and external factors like promotions or weather conditions.
5.    Power BI Integration: The analysis results will be integrated into Power BI, a powerful business intelligence tool. Interactive dashboards and visually appealing reports will be created to present the findings effectively. These reports will contain charts, graphs, and tables, enabling stakeholders to drill down into the data and discover insights easily.
6.    Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Key performance indicators will be defined based on the business objectives. Some potential KPIs include total revenue, average order value, customer acquisition rate, customer retention rate, and geographic distribution of sales.
7.    Data Visualization: Power BI will be utilized to create visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, and geographical maps. These visualizations will help in communicating trends and patterns effectively.
