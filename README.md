# Pizza Sales Analysis (Power BI)

# Introduction:
The Pizza Sales Analysis project aims to provide valuable insights and actionable information to a pizza restaurant chain by analyzing their sales data. This project uses Power BI for data analysis and visualization, allowing the stakeholders to make informed decisions, identify trends, and optimize their business strategies. The project is divided into following phases:

# 1. Ask Phase:
Problem Statement: Understand the performance and trends in pizza sales to optimize operations and maximize revenue.
# Questions:
What is the average order value?
How many pizzas are typically ordered per transaction?
Which days and months have the highest sales?
What are the total number of orders, pizzas sold, and revenue generated?
# 2. Prepare Phase:
Data Collection: Gather pizza sales data with relevant columns (order_id, quantity, order_date, total_price, etc.).
Data Cleaning: Ensure data integrity, handle missing values, and format columns as needed.
Feature Engineering: Create new features like average order value, average pizzas per order, order day, and order month using DAX expressions provided.
# 3. Process Phase:
Data Transformation: Use Power Query to perform any necessary transformations like renaming columns, removing duplicates, or filtering data.
Feature Calculation: Calculate new metrics such as total orders, total pizzas sold, and total revenue using DAX expressions provided.
# 4. Analyze Phase:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the data visually and statistically to identify patterns, trends, and outliers.
Key Findings:

- Friday saw the highest number of pizza sales, while Sunday had the lowest.
- The Classic pizza category was the most popular, while Chicken was the least.
- Sales peaked from March to August but declined in February, October, and December.
- Revenue was evenly distributed among pizza categories, with Supreme and Classic pizzas contributing significantly.
- Large pizzas were the top-selling items, while small pizzas had lower sales.

# 5. Present/Visualize Phase:
Dashboard Design: Design an interactive dashboard using Power BI to visualize the data and insights.
# Visualization:
Daily trend for total orders
Sales for each pizza category
Monthly trend of sales
Percentage of sales for each pizza category
Total revenue generated by pizza category
Pizza sales percentage by pizza size
